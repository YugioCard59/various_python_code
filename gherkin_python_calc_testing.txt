***
This software testing example uses the Gherkin syntax applied to the Python Calculator Library for use within Robot Framework (open source automation framework). 
This test example tests the functionality of the Calculator program and it's dependencies with some general tests checking operation of +=-*/**

Documentation     Example test case using the gherkin syntax.
...
...               This test has a workflow similar to the keyword-driven
...               examples. The difference is that the keywords use higher
...               abstraction level and their arguments are embedded into
...               the keyword names.
...
...               This kind of _gherkin_ syntax has been made popular by
...               [http://cukes.info|Cucumber]. It works well especially when
...               tests act as examples that need to be easily understood also
...               by the business people.
